  - _Input_: `this is a test`
  - _Expected_: `This is a test.`

  - _Input_: `i recieved teh package yesterday`
  - _Expected_: `I received the package yesterday.`
- **Multiple Sentences**: Handling sentence boundaries.
  - _Input_: `hello there. how are you today? it is sunny`
  - _Expected_: `Hello there. How are you today? It is sunny.`
- **Whitespace**: Cleaning up irregular spacing.
  - _Input_: ` Too much    space here  `
  - _Expected_: `Too much space here.`
- **Case Preservation**: Maintaining capitalization on corrected typos.
  - _Input_: `Teh adress is wrong`
